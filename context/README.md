# 🧠 Shared Context

This folder contains "Grounding Files." These are static text files describing our internal standards.

## 🚀 How to use
Before starting a complex chat with an AI, **upload or paste** the relevant file from this folder first. This "primes" the AI with our specific constraints.

## 📂 Available Contexts
* `tech_stack.md`: Our current architecture (AWS, Python versions, Library choices).
* `brand_voice.md`: Guidelines for tone, terminology, and prohibited phrases.
* `project_specs.md`: Summaries of active projects (e.g., Auto Insight Modernization).

## 💡 Tip
If you find yourself explaining the same thing to the AI twice, write it down here.
